//! Tier 1 plugin worker host: spawn, supervise, and speak ndjson JSON-RPC
//! with plugin workers (D1, D8 of the plugin-system design).
//!
//! A worker is the executable named by the manifest's `[runtime]` section
//! (builtin plugins run `aoe __plugin-worker --id <id>` from the current
//! binary), spawned through the active [`super::sandbox::SandboxBackend`]
//! with piped stdio. The wire format is one JSON-RPC 2.0 object per line:
//!
//! - host -> worker requests: contributed actions, commands, status batches;
//! - worker -> host requests: the capability-gated host API below;
//! - host -> worker notifications: subscribed bus events (`events.event`).
//!
//! Every worker-initiated call passes through [`authorize`]: a method whose
//! capability was not granted for the worker's exact manifest hash is refused
//! (acceptance criterion 4 of #268). Workers are expected to exit on stdin
//! EOF; the host kills them on shutdown and respawns crashed workers within a
//! small per-process budget.
//!
//! The host is deliberately synchronous (std threads + channels): it is
//! called from the TUI event loop, one-shot CLI handlers, and (via
//! `spawn_blocking`) the server, and none of those want a runtime handoff.
